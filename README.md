# BreathCounter
Arduino code to count the breathing rate from the analog domain

* The code needs to be compiled to check to check for errors before downloading
it to the boards. 
* The LED should blink after uploading/breassing the reset button on the chip. 
This indicates the waiting stage before data sampling
* The data will be collected in the next minute when the blinking stops. The end of 
data collection will be indicated when one of trhe external LEDs lights up
* Green LED indicates that the breathing rate is in a good range and
the Red LED is for fast breathing
*
